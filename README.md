## Findings 

* The current main citi bike riders fall into young male group between 18 -20 but number of femal reiders increases over time as they are showing interest to start riding during the weekend
* As the temperature gets cold as winter begins, people tend not to ride as well because of the lack of comfort individuals face when riding in
low temperatures. Therefore, at some point the ridership does not grow. Therefore, the amount of ridership begins to fall
