This [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) has been processed to remove trips that are taken by staff as they service and inspect the system, 
trips that are taken to/from any of our “test” stations (which were using more in June and July 2013), and any trips that were below 60 seconds in length 
(potentially false starts or users trying to re-dock a bike to ensure it's secure).

## Findings

#### As the temperature gets cold as winter begins, people tend not to ride as well because of the lack of comfort individuals face when riding in
low temperatures. Therefore, at some point the ridership does not grow. However, the total amount of annual member have been kept increased over time in 2017
